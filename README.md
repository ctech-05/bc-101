Dec 2022 - Another init using Ethereum blockchain. This go around, the idea was to use Quorum ethereum client rather than the native geth flavor. Any new learnings from using a different client as well experimenting with the privacy features unique to Quorum was the basic argument to use Quorum.  Became aware of QBFT, IBFT consensus protocols.
